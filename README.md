# Online-Banking-System
An advanced project based on an Online Banking System which uses PHP Language with MySQL Database.

In particular, this Banking System Project in PHP focuses mainly on managing transactions, savings, and much more. To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of all transactions within. Also, the system displays all the available debit and credit reports. In addition, the system allows for savings accounts too(codeastro.com). Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with a customer panel. Highlighting the features of this advanced banking system project in PHP, it contains every feature for the management side of things. In an overview of this web application, a customer has to register by themselves. For this, a customer has to go through a number of steps including the submission of KYC. Where he/she needs to upload their citizenship card as well as pan number. After submission of the registration form, it’ll require manual verification from the administrator.

# Customer Panel
A customer can only use internet banking services only after the approval from banking administrator. Under the customer panel, the users can perform a number of important tasks. Customers of the bank can view their total balance including total savings with reports of the total credited and debited of the month. The system also generates a bar graph representing daily transactions of credit and debit amounts. Along with it, there’s also a graphical representation using a pie chart to display total cash flow. On top of that, he/she can view and update their profile(codeastro.com). The users can know about their account details from the profile section where he/she can view account numbers, types, and more. The bank customers can also apply for virtual debit cards simply by submitting an auto-generated form. Which also needs approval from an administrator.

# Transfer Amount and Savings
As the project name itself states online banking system, and its feature should surely support that. As the users of the system can transfer amounts to any customer within the system. In order to transfer the money to another account, the user has to provide an account number and the total amount. There are certain validations under this section such as the amount should be equal to or less than the sender’s total balance. Also, the minimum amount must be 50 dollars for the amount to be transferred. Next, the savings section is where the customers can add up a certain amount for savings. He/she can set up targets for savings(codeastro.com) too. The user just has to enter an amount for savings as well as set up targets. The system also shows savings target progress. Having said that, the customers can also transfer the savings into the main account.

# Customer’s Transaction History and Cards
After all those transfers of amounts whether credited or debited, the customer can have a detailed view under the transaction section. In fact, this section lists all the transaction history of the customers. The transaction history lists the name of the customer with their account number, amount, transaction date, and status. Here, status refers to being credit and debit(codeastro.com). The bank users can view the transaction time along with the dates from it as well. On top of that, the users can also print out the transaction history with ease. The client users can also view their virtual cards from the cards section. And that’s only after getting approval from the system administrator. There, the users can have a look at their cards with details such as account number, card number, CVV number, and more.

# Admin Panel
An admin has full control over the system. He/she can manage customers, withdraw, deposit money, and so on. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name, images, and other important details. Here, an admin can view total customers along with an overview of active, pending, and deactivated accounts. With it, the system also notifies about pending customers(codeastro.com). Also, an administrator can have an overview number of total transactions as well as total transactions past 24 hours. The system generates a report on the daily accounts created and represents them using a bar graph. In addition to that, the system also represents overall account status using a pie chart. Here, an account status refers to the state of being active, pending, or deactivated.

# Deposit and Withdraw Money
One of the main functionality of this online banking system project is depositing and withdrawing money. This particular section works as a teller service(codeastro.com). Where the customer requests to deposit the money. In return, the system user has to verify and deposit the money into their respective customer’s account. In order to deposit money, the user has to provide the account number and total amount. There’s a validation in this section too. And the same process goes out to withdrawing money too. Here, withdrawing money is used to deduct the amount from a customer’s account for certain actions or charges from the bank. In fact, both of these section requires a minimum total of 50 dollars for successful transactions. Which is also a part of system validation. Also, the user has to provide a valid account number in order to proceed with the transaction.

# Transfer Money
Transferring money has never been easier before on online banking projects. Just like the above mentioned under the customer section, the administrator can also transfer the amount from one account to another. That too without any extra charges from the bank. This transfer section works in cases where a customer wants to deposit a certain amount to others(codeastro.com). And this one too falls under the teller service. The user has to provide the account number of the sender and receiver before entering the amount. Before anything else, the system displays the sender and receiver’s account information along with their total balance. This in fact helps to verify if the given account numbers are correct. The after, the user can proceed by entering the total amount that needs to be transferred. The validation here requires a minimum total of 50 dollars for successful transactions.

# Customer Accounts
Moreover, the bank administrator can view a list of all the registered customers from this particular section. The customer accounts section is divided into four different categories. Edit, activate, deactivate, and close accounts are the categories that fall under. First thing first, the edit account section helps the system users to view and update the details of the customer’s account. Speaking of details of the customers, the user can only update personal details such as name, contact, email, etc. As the name itself speaks for the rest two section, those are to activate and deactivate a customer’s account. In fact, the deactivated users cannot access the system just like the pending ones(codeastro.com). And the remaining one, the close account is to remove the account in need. It works as a removal of the account from the system. And all of these section contains a quick search for account numbers.

# Account Verification
Moving toward the account verification side, all the registered accounts are transferred here by default. As mentioned earlier, each and every customer’s registration requires an approval action from the administrator(codeastro.com). This is the one we’ll be talking about in more detail. The system alerts the administrator regarding the number of pending users from the top bar. In fact, this counter section is presented like a friend request section just like in social media websites. After heading towards the verification section, the admin can view a list of customers with their detailed information. Such as their personal details with their uploaded KYC documents. With this, the administrator can simply verify/approve or reject/decline the account depending upon their account details. All the account details are generated automatically by the system after the submission of the registration form by the customers.

# Transaction History and Card Requests
On the other hand, the admin can list details of all the transactions done within the system. This does not apply only to the system administrator but also applies to all the customer’s activities. From the transaction history, the user can view the names of customers (sender, receiver), account numbers, dates, and amounts, with status. Truly, this feature lets you know about the transaction history of all the customers as well as the system(codeastro.com). It helps to maintain transparency between clients and the banking system with their detailed transactions. Talking about the card requests, all the requested cards are listed here for approval from the administrator. The customers submit an auto-generated form requesting a virtual card which directly results in the card requests section. Here, the system automatically generated cards and CVV numbers.

The system administrator can view the names of requested customers along with card numbers, CVV, account numbers, and their status before taking any actions. Just like verifying an account, the user can simply approve or reject the card request. In fact, customers can only view their card information after getting approval from the bank administrator. Last but not least, a clean and simple dashboard is presented with various color combinations for a greater user experience while using this Online Banking System Project in PHP MySQL. For its UI elements, a free open-source CSS framework; Bootstrap is on board with some Vanilla CSS too. Presenting a new Banking System Project in PHP MySQL which includes an admin panel with a customer panel. That too contains all the essential features to follow up and is a knowledgeable resource for learning purposes.
